Other results: 
results on the newest version 1.2.4 of Gerbil can be found here: http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil/experiment?id=201610270004 . The InKB results are the ones of interest (since we do not address the issue of out of KB entities). Please note that there is a drop in performance of all systems from version 1.1.4 to version 1.2.* of Gerbil (details here: https://github.com/AKSW/gerbil/issues/98)


To run the code, use 'mvn package'. The jars will be found in the target/ folder. However, it requires various indexes files made from Wikipedia, Crosswikis and the test datasets:

UPDATE: indexes are now available online : https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/IOWjGrU3mjyzDSV
